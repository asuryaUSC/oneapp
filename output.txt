3. Hard boil 6 of your eggs, cool them under cold water, peel, halve, and set them aside.
4. In a pan, melt some butter and fry the chopped onions and ground pork until the pork is browned. Sprinkle with flour, stir well, and cook for another 3 minutes.
5. Take a greased ovenproof dish and spread the mashed potato mixture at the bottom. Layer it with the pork mixture and top with thinly sliced cucumbers.
6. Place the tomato halves and egg halves around the edge of the dish to create pie-like portions.
7. Whisk the remaining 4 eggs with milk, salt, parsley, and pepper. Pour this over the dish and bake for 40 minutes or until done. If it browns too quickly, cover with foil until fully cooked.
8. Let it sit for a few minutes before serving, then cut into wedges and enjoy!
